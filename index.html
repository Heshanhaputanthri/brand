  <h1>GDP per Capita </h1>
  <h4>Which countries perform the best?</h4>
  <br/>
  <p>Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country over a certain time period. It is important to measure GDP as it is an indicator of the economies size and performance. GDP per Capita is the GDP divided by the population of the country. It is a useful unit to make cross-country comparisons of average living standards.</p>
  
   <p> GDP per Capita strongly correlates with a number of metrics and indicaotrs which measure the general living standards of an economy. Lets explore these metrics through some visualisations. </p>
  
  <h4>Are countries with Higher GDP per Capita Happier?</h4>

                  vegaEmbed('#WhyGDP', spec2).then(function(result) {
                    // Access the Vega view instance (https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/) as result.view

        <div class="column" style="background-color:#96D1CD;">
          <p>It is seen that there is a strong correlation between GDP per Capita and Happiness as well as life freedom. Countries with <b>higher GDP per Capita</b> tend to be countries with <b>lower rates of unemployment</b> which also plays a role in the metrics explored in the graphs. </p>
          
          <p>This is mainly due to the increased disposable income as a result of increased per capita income.</p>

        <div class="column" style="background-color:#96D1CD;">
          <p>Higher levels of GDP per Capita tend to be associated with higher life expectancies as seen in the plot. On average, European countries tend to have high GDP per Capita due to the abundance of Tourism, Human Capitan and Technology. Whereas African countries tend to deal with military dictatorships, corruption, civil unrest and war, underdevelopment and deep poverty which largely impacts the continents economic growth and thus GDP per Capita.</p>
          
          <p>Countries in the Asian continent tend to perform better than African countries on avergae due to the absense of deep poverty however do not perform as well as European countries due to the lack of Tourism and cutting edge Technology </p>
